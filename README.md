# Codeforces Problem Recommender

<a href = "https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> is a very popular web platform that hosts competitive programming contests. It also has a multitude of problems of varying difficulty levels for all types of programmers, be it a newbie or an expert. 

Often, users find it difficult to choose unsolved problems to solve for practice. We have built a website that **recommends 3 categories of problems** (**Easy**, **Medium** and **Hard**) to the user, **based on his/her codeforces rating**. The problems are randomly chosen, and are only those which are not solved by the user yet.

This repository includes all the codes which the website uses.
